// 1. initialize variable named "i" and  set its value to an empty string
// 2. remember, strings have property .lenght which tells us how long is the string (it's zero indexed)
// 3. as long as the length of the string is less or equal to 10, execute the code
// 4. in every iteration, add (+=) a star to the string
